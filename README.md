### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nolulamo Tshuma

### About Me
I am a versatile graduate electronic engineer seeking a position as a graduate trainee. I believe that the continuous pursuit of knowledge is the key to success.

I have a deep passion for working with embedded systems and IoT technologies, which initially sparked my interest in electronic engineering. In addition, I have a strong affinity for control engineering and automation, as they offer fascinating opportunities to optimize and streamline processes.

Beyond my electronic engineering background, I have also ventured into the realm of web development. I thoroughly enjoy working with HTML, Sass, and jQuery for frontend development, while leveraging the power of Python and Django for backend implementation. This fusion of skills allows me to bridge the gap between hardware and software, creating seamless and efficient solutions.

When I'm not immersed in my technological pursuits, I find solace in spending quality time with my loved ones. Additionally, I have a keen interest in reading self-development books, as they provide valuable insights and fuel my continuous quest for personal and professional improvement.
